## Useful links

[Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) including the react-native API, which is pretty much a mirror of the official RN docs, but may have differences due to the bundled package being a fork.

[React Navigation docs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)

## Your Task

Instead of displaying an alert when the user clicks an event, we want the onPress to take them to the Links screen.

Here are the hints:

[withNavigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/with-navigation.html) React Navigation gives us a HOC that provides the [navigation prop](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigation-prop.html) to the component

The key in the [RouteConfig](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html#routeconfigs) is the route name which is in [MainTabNavigator](https://github.com/richardquaite/react-native-workshop/blob/5-navigation-intro/navigation/MainTabNavigator.js#L40)
