# react-native-workshop

## Useful links

[Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) including the react-native API, which is pretty much a mirror of the official RN docs, but may have differences due to the bundled package being a fork.

[React Navigation docs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)

## Your Task

Add a couple of [buttons](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/react-native/button/) to the event screen.

- a button that opens a [WebBrowser](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/sdk/webbrowser/) and takes you to the checkout.  The checkout url is saved as a variable in the component.
- a button that makes your device [vibrate](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/react-native/vibration/) for 0.5s
